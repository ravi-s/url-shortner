# URL Shortener (Mini System Design Project)

A lightweight URL Shortener built as part of a hands-on system design learning journey.

## 🔧 What It Does

- Takes a long URL and returns a shortened version.
- Resolves a short URL back to the original long URL.
- Stores URL mappings in memory (for now).
- Designed to be extended into a scalable, production-grade system.

## 🚀 Getting Started

- Git (optional but recommended)

### Run It

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ravi-s/url-shortener.git
cd url-shortener

# Run the script
python shortener.py
